The ICook application saves your go-to recipes with additional functions such as filtering by total cooking time and ingredients matching. The ingredients matching function allows users to input the ingredients the have and the app returns a recipe with the highest match of ingredients. The feature was built specifically with grocery waste control in mind while the cooking time filter feature was built for on-the-go usersâ€™ convenience.

This ICook server was built using RESTful architecture, PostgreSQL, knex, and express. Authentication and cross-site scripting were addressed during development to ensure client and server security.

Tested using: mocha, chai
