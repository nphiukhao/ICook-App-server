            'Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo', 
            '35', 
            'Cook fettuccini in a pot of salted water (4 qts water, 1 Tbsp salt,) according to package instructions then drain and set aside.
            Meanwhile, slice chicken into strips and season all over with salt and pepper. In a large skillet, heat 2 Tbsp olive oil over medium/high heat and sauté chicken until
            lightly golden and cooked through (5 min). Remove chicken from the pan and cover to keep warm. In the same pan over medium/high, heat 1 Tbsp olive oil and 1 Tbsp of 
            butter. Add onion and sauté 3 min until soft. Add sliced mushrooms and sauté until soft (5-7 min), stirring frequently. Add garlic and sauté 30 seconds, stirring constantly. 
            Add half-n-half and simmer over medium/high heat 8-10 min, or until beginning to thicken. Add chicken back to the pan, add 1/4 cup parsley and season sauce to taste (1/2 to 1 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper). 
            Add cooked pasta and stir to combine. Heat another minute until warmed through then turn off the heat, cover and let rest 10-15 minutes then stir and serve garnished with parsley.',

             'Kimchi Fried Rice',
             '30',
             'In a nonstick sauté pan or well-seasoned cast-iron skillet, melt butter over medium-low heat, and add onions. Cook, stirring, until the onions start to sizzle, about 2 minutes. Add kimchi 
             and kimchi juice, and stir until it comes to a boil, about 3 minutes. Add Spam, and cook until sauce is nearly dried out, about 5 minutes. Break up the rice in the pan with a spatula, and stir it to incorporate. 
             Turn heat to medium. Cook, stirring, until the rice has absorbed the sauce and is very hot, about 5 minutes. Stir in soy sauce and sesame oil. Taste, and adjust with more soy sauce, sesame oil or kimchi juice. 
             Turn heat down slightly, but let the rice continue to cook, untouched, to lightly brown while you cook the eggs. Place a small nonstick sauté pan over medium heat, and add the vegetable oil. When it is hot, add eggs, season with salt 
             and fry to your desired doneness. Serve rice topped with fried eggs, nori and a sprinkle of sesame seeds.',

             'Thai Red Curry',
             '40',
             'To cook the rice, bring a large pot of water to boil. Add the rinsed rice and continue boiling for 30 minutes, reducing heat as necessary to prevent overflow. 
             Remove from heat, drain the rice and return the rice to pot. Cover and let the rice rest for 10 minutes or longer, until you’re ready to serve. Just before serving, season the rice to taste with salt and fluff it with a fork. 
             To make the curry, warm a large skillet with deep sides over medium heat. Once it’s hot, add the oil. Add the onion and a sprinkle of salt and cook, stirring often, until the onion has softened and is turning translucent, about 5 minutes. 
             Add the ginger and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds, while stirring continuously. Add the bell peppers and carrots. Cook until the bell peppers are fork-tender, 3 to 5 more minutes, stirring occasionally. Then add the curry 
             paste and cook, stirring often, for 2 minutes. Add the coconut milk, water, kale and sugar, and stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer and cook until the peppers, 
             carrots and kale have softened to your liking, about 5 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove the pot from the heat and season with tamari and rice vinegar. Add salt (I added ¼ teaspoon for optimal flavor), to taste. If the curry needs a little more punch, 
             add ½ teaspoon more tamari, or for more acidity, add ½ teaspoon more rice vinegar. Divide rice and curry into bowls and garnish with chopped cilantro and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes, if you’d like. If you love spicy curries, serve with sriracha or chili garlic sauce on the side.',

Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat and gently simmer for 10-12 minutes, stirring often so the pasta doesn’t stick. Adjust the heat accordingly especially at the end. Cook until the pasta is tender and most of the liquid is absorbed. 
            Off the heat, stir in the basil leaves and the Parmesan cheese. Serve immediately (if you want it slightly thicker, let it rest 5-10 minutes; it will thicken as it stands).',
